# R Memes for Statistical Fiends <img src="man/figures/rstatsmemes_logo.png" width="160px" align="right" />

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 10, results = "asis")

library(rstatsmemes)
library(tidyverse)

set.seed(252)
```

Ever wanted to have R Memes at the ready whenever you want? 

*Of course not.* But here is a package that does exactly that.

## Installation

The package is easy to use.

Just install package from GitHub:

```{r, eval = F}
devtools::install_github("favstats/rstatsmemes")
```


## Show Me an R Meme

Let `show_me_an_R_meme` do the rest. This will plot a random R meme from the list of all memes.

```{r, results = "asis"}
show_me_an_R_meme(random_meme = T)
```

Want to check out a list of all memes? You can do this here:

```{r, results='markup'}
glimpse(rstatsmemes::meme_posts)
```


You can also display a specific meme by passing a number from 1 to `r nrow(meme_posts)` (current number of memes on the Facebook page). The number refers to the date when the meme was first posted on Facebook with 1 being the first meme.

```{r}
show_me_an_R_meme(322)
```


## Top 3 Memes

Here are the Top 3 liked memes on the Facebook page:

```{r}
meme_indices <- meme_posts %>% 
  mutate(likes_count = as.numeric(likes_count)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(likes_count)) %>% 
  slice(1:3) %>% 
  pull(meme_number)
```

```{r}
show_me_an_R_meme(meme_indices[1])
```

```{r}
show_me_an_R_meme(meme_indices[2])
```

```{r}
show_me_an_R_meme(meme_indices[3])
```
